A learning environment developed from scratch in java where agents learn to collect "coins".
Currently, agents consist of a feed-forward neural network (also implemented from scratch for educational purposes) that takes the agent's facing direction and the direction of the closest coin as input and outputs a vector that determines the agent's facing direction on the next time-step.
At the end of an episode, agents are evaluated based on their ability to collect coins and the next generation of agents is generated via genetic algorithms.

The enviroment can be expanded to be used with various learning algorithms and agent achitectures.
